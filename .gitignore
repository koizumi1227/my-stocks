# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
/vendor
.keep

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/
/tmp/

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
!/tmp/pids/

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*

/public/assets
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key

/public/packs
